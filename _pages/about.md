Hello! I'm a Roboticist, Engineer, Software Developer at ION Trading, past Research Intern at NTU-Singapore, and a Research Scholar at MITACS-Canada.

I am fundamentally passionate about understanding how human perception & manipulation work and how we can build autonomous systems that have tremendous positive social impact. In pursuit of this passion, I aim to build autonomous perception systems that are at par with the inherent human cognitive capabilities. My research interests lie at the intersection of `Robotics, Computer Vision and Autonomous Systems` especially in the domains of `Manipulation, Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, SLAM and machine vision`.

During my undergraduate days, I was a Team Member of University's Robotics Laboratory advised by [Dr. Shantipal Ohol](https://www.coep.org.in/mycoep/ssomechcoepacin) and have also interned with 2 startups [Exa Mobility](https://www.exa-mobility.com/) and [Binary Robotics](https://www.binaryrobotics.in/).


In addition, I was a former Summer Research Intern at [NTU-Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) under [Dr. Xie Ming](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00965) and was funded by the `NTU-India Connect Scholarship`. I was also fortunate enough to have worked with [Dr. Scott Nokleby](https://ontariotechu.ca/experts/feas/scott-nokleby.php) under the `Canadian MITACS-Globalink'21 Research Scholarship`. 


I am actively looking for PhD positions in Robotics for Fall'24.
